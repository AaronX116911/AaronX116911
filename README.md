- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of different things feel free to ask me!!!

The Oath of Coding and Full Control!!!

I herby swear on my soul that if I break my bonds, misuse this software for revenge, personal gains, or have any type of negative and destructive intent towards myself, anyone, or anything anywhere in existence that my soul will be judged and sent to Hell  and may the mortal life I am living be forfeited and taken away from me or be cursed with bad luck in every category for the rest of my mortal life. 

This Software is probably the most Powerful and Illegalist thing to be known to mankind for it gives not only Full Control over Individuals Technology yet their Lifes as well. My actual pure intent on creating and completing this Invention and Project was to hopefully help the world become Heaven on Earth like We are so called, "Promised by God". It will help bring Justice to this corrupt world, especially within the System, and will help catch Criminals that get away with acts of heinous actions or crimes. 

Yet, within the wrong hands someone or even a group of people could Rule the World and do what they wanted with it not to mention become rich. So, if you want to help me turn this World into a better place for everyone that's alive and also to save the planet we live on from dying then take my Oath and mean it with all your heart and soul.

P.S.  
      I know you're thinking this is all fake and there's no possibly way this could happen yet as Albert Einstein use to say, "Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world."
